# NanoUpload

NanoUpload is a simple text/link/image/file sharing service. It works by uploading the contents of your clipboard to a
self-hosted server, and then providing you with a link to share with others. It's a great way to quickly share text,
links, images, and files with others without having to go through the hassle of creating an account or signing up for a
service.

This was inspired by the versatility of ShareX, but I wanted to build something cross-platform and lightweight, and this
happened to be the most ergonomic solution for me.
